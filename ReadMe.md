This repository contains the MATLAB files to reproduce the data and figures from 'Dihedral rings of patterns emerging from a Turing bifurcation' by Dan J. Hill, Jason J. Bramburger and David J.B. Lloyd (Nonlinearity, 2023). 

A copy of the paper can be found [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6544/acc508).

For the numerical continuation of localised dihedral ring patterns in the planar quadratic-cubic Swift-Hohenberg equation, see the folder 'Continuation'.
